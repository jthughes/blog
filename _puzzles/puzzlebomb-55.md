Fill the grid with the numbers 1-35, using the clues given, so that each row contains 7 numbers each with a different remainder when you divide by 7, and each column contains 5 numbers each with a different remainder when you divide by 5.

The numbers in each of the dotted regions add up to the indicated total.
