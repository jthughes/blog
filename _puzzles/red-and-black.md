An ordinary pack of 52 cards is arranged so that the black and red cards alternate. You cut the deck and do a single riffle shuffle.

Before you began shuffling you noticed that the cards on the bottom of the two piles were different colours. When you’ve finished the shuffle, you begin laying out pairs of cards from the top of the pile.

**What’s the probability that every pair of cards that you lay out has both a red and a black card?**
