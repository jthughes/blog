I have seven sticks, all different lengths, all a whole number of centimetres long. I can tell the longest one is less than 30 cm long, because it’s shorter than a piece of paper, but other than that I have no way of measuring them.

Whenever I pick three sticks from the pile, I find that I can’t ever make a triangle with them.

**How long is the shortest stick?**
