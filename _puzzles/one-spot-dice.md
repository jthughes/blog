You have two blank 6-sided dice. You are allowed to choose any number of the twelve faces and draw exactly one dot on each of those faces. Now roll both dice.

Can you draw the dots so that the possible totals are equally likely?

**Extension:**
Put dots on several faces of two 6-sided blank dice.

Can you do it so all totals are equally likely (with more than two possible totals)?
