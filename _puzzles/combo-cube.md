Eight cubes are marked with one dot on two opposite faces, two dots on two opposite faces and three dots on two opposite faces.

The eight cubes are glued together to form a bigger cube.

The dots on each face of the large cube are counted, to get six totals.

**Can the cubes be arranged so that the six totals are consecutive numbers?**
