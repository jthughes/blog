Pull a single ball out of the box labelled 'Mixed'. This will tell you all you need to know.

If the colour is red, then the box you pulled a ball from must only have red balls (as we know it can't be the mixed box). The box that is labelled 'Blue' cannot contain only blue balls, and so must contain a mixture of both colours. This leaves the box labelled 'Red' to be filled only with blue balls.

The same logic applies if the colour drawn from the box labelled 'Mixed' was blue, only the colours red and blue are reversed. 

The two arrangements are below are the only possiblities, and pulling from the box labelled 'Mixed' tells you which arrangement has occured.

| Box   | Label |
|:-----:|:-----:|
| Red   | Mixed |
| Blue  | Red   |
| Mixed | Blue  |
