# The Rationale
Upon seeing mention of the "[Virtual Conference on Mathematical Flavors](https://samjshah.com/)" on Twitter, I thought "that's neat, but that's not really anything I could contribute to". And then I read the call for presenters.

> You may be thinking… “But no monsieur! I am not worthy of presenting at such an auspicious conference such as this one!” or “I don’t even have a blog!” And to that, I say “Pssssshaw!” I firmly believe that all teacher voices have value, from first-year teachers to veteran teachers, and yours does too.

Well then. I do already have a blog (albeit with little in it), and I could be seen as a first-year teacher as I teach for a full term before getting my teacher registration. But then I'm still left with the question of how could I possibly answer the prompt? 

> How does your class move the needle on what your kids think about the doing of math, or what counts as math, or what math feels like, or who can do math? 

I've not taught in a school from the start of the year, and I still feel like I'm working on getting through each day or week rather than truly purposefully working towards lasting long-term change in student outlooks on mathematics. So I can't talk from experience of how I make that happen, or what I intend on changing in my class to improve since last year. What I can do, however, is reflect on what I would like to have happen in my classrooms in the future. The very exercise of doing that will likely help me to plan, and then implement those ideas once I am in a position to do so. By sharing these thoughts, maybe I'll get the chance to discuss them with others to develop them further, and just maybe there might be something useful to anyone who chooses to read these thoughts.

So what then is my vision for transforming how my students see mathematics?

# The Vision
- Mathematics as playful/joyful
- annecdotes about maths as a child
    - mum re: preschool subtraction
    - 3 digit addition
    - highschool musings
    - 100!
