On the precipice, on the edge of the first day of the first placement, I feel time poor. I feel like I've been doing all this stuff for uni but that none of it helps me be prepared for tomorrow. Tomorrow, I step into the classroom and the students problems become my problems. Tomorrow is waking up to being on a loop with no end, struggling through preparing the next days classes while trying to reflect on that day's failures, on top of catching up on yesterday's homework. Time is up, but do I know how to react in the myriad of potential situations that could arise in the classroom? How will I remember all the strategies for behaviour management, lesson and assessment design, and other student or parent interactions?
Tomorrow has been sometimes exciting, sometimes terrifying, often simultaneously. Immediately, it just feels terrifying.
